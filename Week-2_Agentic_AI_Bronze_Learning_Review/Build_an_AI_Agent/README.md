The takeaway from this exercise should be on how it:
* Connects to the AI Foundry project.
* Uploads the data file and creates a code interpreter tool that can access it.
* Creates a new agent that uses the code interpreter tool and has explicit instructions to use Python as necessary for statistical analysis.
* Runs a thread with a prompt message from the user along with the data to be analyzed.
* Checks the status of the run in case there’s a failure.
* Retrieves the messages from the completed thread and displays the last one sent by the agent.
* Displays the conversation history.
* Deletes the agent and thread when they’re no longer required.
