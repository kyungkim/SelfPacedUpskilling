The focus of this exercise should be on how it:
* Adds your set of custom functions to a toolset
* Creates an agent that uses the toolset.
* Runs a thread with a prompt message from the user.
* Checks the status of the run in case there’s a failure
* Retrieves the messages from the completed thread and displays the last one sent by the agent.
* Displays the conversation history
* Deletes the agent and thread when they’re no longer required.
